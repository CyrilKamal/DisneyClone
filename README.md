### `What is this for?`

I created this to put all my full-stack experience in one project. I built this application on React JS. It uses Firebase for the google auth popup, also as a database to host images and text and links, and is what I deployed the application on. Styled components were just for the CSS code and styling. I used redux to create real, functioning sign in usability.
